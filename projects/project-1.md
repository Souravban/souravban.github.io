summary: Image Classification on the RVL-CDIP Dataset using VGG16 Network.

  <img class="ui image" src="../images/Image_Classification_Decoded_Banner.png">

The RVL-CDIP (Ryerson Vision Lab Complex Document Information Processing) dataset consists of 400,000
grayscale images in 16 classes, with 25,000 images per class. There are 320,000 training images, 40,000
validation images, and 40,000 test images. The images are sized so their largest dimension does not exceed
1000 pixels.
Here are the classes in the dataset, and an example from each:





```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
