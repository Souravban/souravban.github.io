Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are deﬁned as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository1): CRIM: per capita crime rate by town 2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. 3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town 4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) 5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) 1https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing 123 20.2. Load the Dataset 124 6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling 7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 8. DIS: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers 9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways 10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 12. B: 1000(Bk−0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population 14. MEDV: Median value of owner occupied homes in $1000s We can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.

<b>Problem Statement</b> : In this challenge, we are Predicting of House Prices in Boston depending upon multiple parameters.
